## 🛠️ Technologies

- **React** 18.2.0 - UI library
- **TypeScript** 5.9.3 - Type safety
- **Vite** 5.0.8 - Build tool and dev server
- **CSS Modules** - Scoped component styling
- **Recharts** - Charting library
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

## 📝 Development

### Component Structure

Each component follows this pattern:
- `ComponentName.tsx` - TypeScript React component with typed props
- `ComponentName.module.css` - CSS module for component-specific styles

### TypeScript

The project uses strict TypeScript configuration. All components are typed with proper interfaces for props and state.

## 📦 Build Output

The production build generates optimized static files including:
- Minified JavaScript bundles
- Optimized CSS
- Service Worker for PWA functionality
- Static assets

## 🔧 Configuration

### Vite

Configuration can be modified in `vite.config.ts`.

### TypeScript

TypeScript compiler options are in `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`.

## 📄 License

This project is part of the ForfettAIro suite for managing Italian VAT regime (regime forfettario).

## 🧪 The Vibecoding Experiment

This started as an experiment in pure vibecoding. V1 was built entirely with the Claude iOS app, but it couldn't handle deployment. After manually deploying and configuring Netlify (the meme "AI: why can't they see my new site on localhost" is real), I started using GitHub Copilot for new features.

It didn't go badly until: I found conflicts to resolve... in the `node_modules` folder, a couple of "undefined is not a function" (sigh), and most importantly, hallucinations. So I had to bring out Claude Code and managed to rewrite the project so it wasn't a complete mess anymore.

The vibecoding experiment failed on some CSS and UI bugs that I just couldn't solve with prompting alone, but the product is still nice and it's a tool I'm proud of. Let's see how it goes.
